## Why did I build Presidio?
- My desire to turn something that requires payment and with limitations into something that is now free and limitless.
- Getting a taste of Flask and full-stack development and how a software product works
- Desire to learn how to write code using 3-tier architecture 

## Why use Presidio?
- Before Presidio, people relied on CBOE and other options dataset providers and pay for datasets that otherwise could have been free
  - Otherwise, they would manually connect to a mulitple APIs to extract options data, create a CSV, and inject that CSV with the data extracted from the APIs
- With Presidio, users can enter their desired stock/ETF symbol and the expiration date, distract themselves with something for 2-5 min. (while the software is running), and come back to see a complete dataset of the stock/ETF's options chains and Greeks
- At no cost, downloadable, and with unlimited usage
